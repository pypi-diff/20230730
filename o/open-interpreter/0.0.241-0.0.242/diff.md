 ## How Does it Work?
 
 Open Interpreter equips a [function-calling GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) with the `exec()` function.
 
 We then stream the model's messages, code, and your system's outputs to the terminal as Markdown.
 
 Only the last `model_max_tokens` of the conversation are shown to the model, so conversations can be any length, but older messages may be forgotten.
